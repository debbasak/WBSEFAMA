  						"All knowledge that the world has ever received comes from the mind; the infinite library of the universe is in our own mind" ..... Swami Vivekananda.
  					</p>
  					<p>
  						“Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it is the only thing that ever has.”— Margaret Mead.
  					</p>
					<p>
						You have to hold yourself accountable for your actions, and that’s how we’re going to protect the Earth. Lets take a pledge today to “GO GREEN” in almost all the activities we can. As responsible members of a responsible Association (WBSEFAMA) “ WE” are also adopting “go green initiatives”.
					</p>
					<p>
						As a first action towards this, from this AGM and henceforth, we will not publish & print hard copies of our official organ CORE.  On the contrary we will publish the e-version only for all. Official Notices, Financial statements of WBSEFAMA and mostly all communications will now be sent electronically and through our website and emails. This will also lead to savings in cost and optimum DIGITALISATION of our operations.
					</p>
                    <p>
						It gives me immense pleasure to address all of you through the Website of WBSEFAMA (www.wbsefama.org) which is being launched after lots of  hard work . On this occasion , I congratulate the entire team of the WBSEFAMA which was entrusted to make this possible. Special kudos to the  Sub -Committee constituted for this purpose. The committee has been delivering more than my expectations.
		            </p>
                    <p>
						I hope the website would now be made fully operational in the days to come with lots of useful information which would be beneficial for our members in their work sphere.
		            </p>
                    <p>
						I am also made to understand that there would be two standing sub-committees which would supervise the day to day maintenance and functioning of this  website. I urge upon and request all concerned with the functioning of this website, to bring in new and interesting features continuously, which would go a long way in making it such an informative platform, which we can all be proud of.
					</p>
                    <p>
						Any suggestions from our members would always be welcome ,in making the website more pertinent, informative and useful.
		            </p>
                    <p>
						We are approaching the 50th Year of our formation and I propose to form a high powered committee of WBSEFAMA to celebrate the glorious 50 years of our beloved Association the WBSEFAMA. It has to be a memorable and a gala event.

  					<p>
  						All our members are performing their work with sincerity and dedication in this ever-changing environment with lots of challenges and constraints. It is we the finance persons who have collectively contributed the most in the journey of success of WBSEDCL.
  					</p>
  					<p>
  						I want to thank and express my gratitude to all the Zonal Committee members for their efforts and time they have given in resolving various issues of our members. Also, I would congratulate the Siliguri Zonal Committee members for conducting a memorable Zonal Committee meeting. Finally, I would really appreciate and acknowledge the hard work of all our members and assure you that association will always be by your side for all kind of support.
